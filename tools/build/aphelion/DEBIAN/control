Description: securely and consistently replicate an application on many machines
 Aphelion is software for securely and consistently replicating an application on many machines. By securely, we mean that Aphelion works even if up to 1/3 of machines fail in arbitrary ways. By consistently, we mean that every non-faulty machine sees the same transaction log and computes the same state.
